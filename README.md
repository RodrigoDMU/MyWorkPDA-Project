## Principles of Data Analytics - Project Palmer Penguins

This repository was created as part of the [Principles of Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/principles-of-data-analytics) assessment module for the course in the [Higher Diploma in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics?_gl=1*1bcdos0*_ga*MTE3OTU2MzQ5LjE2OTY2MDYwMzE.*_ga_5R02GBYV8V*MTcxNDMzOTE2Ni4xMS4xLjE3MTQzMzkyMDAuMC4wLjA.) at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/). This README has been written with [Github's Documentation On READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind. [[1]](#1) This project is using the dataset [palmerpenguis](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) to demonstrate the skills developed in the course in data analysis and vizualization. [[2]](#2) You can find more about [writing in Mark Down in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## About This Project

This project is about the ["palmer penguins"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv) dataset, it is a dataset on penguins of three different species that contains information on the penguins body measurements, including bill length and depth (mm), flipper length (mm), and body mass (g), as well as sex information. This dataset is widely used in education and research to teach and model data analysis techniques.

There are three species of penguins in the dataset: Adelie (*Pygoscelis adeliae*), Gentoo (*Pygoscelis papua*) and Chinstrap (*Pygoscelis antarctica*). Data was collected from 3 different locations: Dream, Torgersen and Biscoe at Palmer Station in Antarctica.

The culmen is the upper ridge of a birdâ€™s bill. In the simplified penguins data, culmen length and depth are renamed as variables `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` to be more intuitive.

For this penguin data, the culmen (bill) length and depth are measured as shown below (thanks Kristen Gorman for clarifying!): [[2]](#2) [[4]](#4)

## Use of This Project

This project is useful for demonstrating some of the skills developed for analysis, programming and data visualization using Jupyter Notebook (Python) and ReadMe.md.

## Getting Started

I used [openincolab](https://openincolab.com/) to generate the following clickable link.
It opens the [`penguins.ipynb`](https://github.com/RodrigoDMU/MyWorkPDA-Project/blob/main/penguins.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
