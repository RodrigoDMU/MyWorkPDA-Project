## Principles of Data Analytics - Project Palmer Penguins

This repository was created as part of the [Principles of Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/principles-of-data-analytics) assessment module for the course in the [Higher Diploma in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics?_gl=1*1bcdos0*_ga*MTE3OTU2MzQ5LjE2OTY2MDYwMzE.*_ga_5R02GBYV8V*MTcxNDMzOTE2Ni4xMS4xLjE3MTQzMzkyMDAuMC4wLjA.) at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/). This README has been written with [Github's Documentation On READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind. This project is using the dataset [palmerpenguis](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) to demonstrate the skills developed in course in data analysis and vizualization. You can find more about [writing in Mark Down in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
